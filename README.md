# LittleFrames
In dev backport and wrap of LittleFrames + Dependencies 
Â¿Why i do that?
In firts place, i haven't enought time to learn how to use CreativeCore-1.18 
and do a backport of 2 mods (littletiles included).
So, wrap everything is my "easy" way to skip that.

No clone repo or make a custom build if is not released any dev build.

Note of SrRapero720: No longer works

In order to make it work you need to build https://github.com/CreativeMD/vlcj + https://github.com/CreativeMD/vlcj-natives yourself.

Steps
* Clone these two repositories to your computer
* Add them to your eclipse (or any other development software) workspace
* In Eclipse right click project -> Run As -> Maven install
* If it compiles successfully you are done!
